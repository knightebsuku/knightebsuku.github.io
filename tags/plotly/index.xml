      <description>I was recently looking for a used car, specifically a Mercedes Benz. To get a general idea of the used car market prices, I needed to collect data about the prices.
There are various websites, in South Africa, that have a huge selection of used and new cars such as autotrader
Manually searching for &amp;ldquo;Mercedes Benz&amp;rdquo; yielded about 4500 results, nice. Even though I was searching for a specific class, I choose to rather search on the general &amp;ldquo;Mercedes Benz&amp;rdquo; rather than say &amp;ldquo;Mercedes Benz C180&amp;rdquo; as I thought this might also include cars which might not have the class name in them.</description>
