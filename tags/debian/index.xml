      <description>For the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to better manage my plastic bags of receipts, finally got around to build an application to archive my receipts and to keep track of my expenses. Its a very simple application and hopefully down the line I&amp;rsquo;ll be able do do some analysis on the data I generate.
Check out the project here</description>

      <description>Concept - Django project as a debian package For the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering whether it would be possible to package a full django project as debian package (.deb).
Now and then I tend to write small web applications that run on my machine and use the SQLite database. On one occasion somebody asked if they could run the application on their machine.
These small web applications tend to just use Django, Django Rest Framework, JavaScript(eg: jquery) and a CSS framework that does not need to be customised or built and on some occasions a background task like celery.</description>
